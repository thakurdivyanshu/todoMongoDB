# todoMongoDB
This is a todo list web app developed by me . 
You can create your tasks to this list and update/delete them too.
The frontend has HTML,CSS and JS while in the backend I have used MongoDB database to store the tasks. 

Its deployed using heroku : https://guarded-thicket-63928.herokuapp.com/
